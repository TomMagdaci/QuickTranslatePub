Versions:
1.3 feature removed - minimize before maximize,
    reason: speed. Currently, minimize happens 4 sec after initializing, then in every action it will maximize and after that minimize.
1.4 feature update - clicking on mouses's left-click pauses the window's minimizing for 4 seconds
1.5 feautres updates - updating the pausing time at the initializing before minimizing to be 3 seconds instead of 4 seconds.
